# Sentiment Analysis on Amazon Reviews using Naive Bayes & NLTK's Vader Sentiment Scoring
A sentiment analysis project utilizing NLTKâ€™s Vader Sentiment Scoring to classify customer reviews as positive, neutral, or negative. The project includes data preprocessing scripts, detailed Jupyter notebooks, and visualization examples.

## Project Overview :
This project leverages NLTK's Vader Sentiment Scoring to perform sentiment analysis on customer reviews. The goal is to classify each review as positive, negative, or neutral, providing valuable insights into customer opinions. The tool is particularly well-suited for analyzing short texts, such as social media posts or reviews, due to its ability to detect contextual polarity.

## How Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier works :
Multinomial Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classification algorithm commonly used for text classification tasks, such as spam detection or sentiment analysis. It operates on the assumption that features (typically word counts or frequencies) are conditionally independent given the class label, which simplifies calculations. The model calculates the probability of each class based on the frequency of each feature (e.g., word) within the class and then applies Bayes' theorem to estimate the likelihood of a document belonging to each class. The class with the highest probability is chosen as the predicted label. This algorithm is particularly effective for discrete data and works well with text data represented as bag-of-words or term frequency vectors. Despite its simplicity, Multinomial Naive Bayes often performs well in practice due to its robustness and efficiency in handling large-scale data.

## How Vader Sentiment Scoring Works :
The Vader (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) algorithm calculates sentiment scores based on the presence of positive and negative words, as well as the intensity of these words. It also considers punctuation, capitalization, and degree modifiers (e.g., words like "very" or "extremely") to improve accuracy.

The resulting score ranges from:

Positive (Compound > 0.05)
Neutral (Compound between -0.05 and 0.05)
Negative (Compound < -0.05)
